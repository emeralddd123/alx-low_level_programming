# C - Variables, if, else, while

In this project, I learned about using arithmetic, logical, relational, and boolean
operators in C. Additionally, I practiced declaring and defining variables of type
`char`, `int`, and `unsigned int`, using `if` and `if...else` statements, and
implementing `while` loops.
